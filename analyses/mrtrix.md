# MRtrix3

MRtrix3 is a powerful diffusion MRI analysis toolbox. In our lab we use MRtrix3 to generate structural connectomes and perform higher-order/advanced diffusion tractography.

You can find MRtrix3 [here](https://www.mrtrix.org/). A good starting point with MRtrix3 is their [beginner DWI tutorial](https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/beginner_dwi_tutorial.html).

For an example of how we leveraged MRtrix3 in the lab, please refer to Behan et al.'s [Comparison of Diffusion-Weighted MRI Reconstruction Methods for Visualization of Cranial Nerves in Posterior Fossa Surgery](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00554/full).
