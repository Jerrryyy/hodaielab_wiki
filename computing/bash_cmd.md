# Bash and Linux command line
BASH (or Bourne against Shell) is the basic command line interpteter for the UNIX-based operation systems (Like MacOS, or Linux). Most of the apps and scripts used in the lab are based on Bash.

The [University of Toronto Coders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/misc/bash-intro/lesson/) have a great tutorial lesson where they cover basic aspects of interacting with computer and file system using BASH.
