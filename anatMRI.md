### Anatomical MRI
Anatomical MRI is used to visualize gross anatomical structure non-invasively in humans. In our lab, we use anatomical MRI (T1-weighted and T2-weighted) with or without contrast to identify particular regions within the PNS and CNS of humans. This allows us to then examine differences/abnormalities that may exist between diseased and healthy control individuals.
