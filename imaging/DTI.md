### Diffusion Weighted Imaging

Diffusion weighted imaging can provide information that can be further used to generate diffusion tensor images. After which, we can visualize the white matter and associated microstructural properties for body tissues. In our lab, we use diffusion weighted images to visualize peripheral nerves and major white matter pathways within the brain. For more details on how to set up a Linux environment to perform these analyses.

Here are some steps to set-up your machine for DTI analyses:
1. Mrtrix3
2. blob
3. fish
