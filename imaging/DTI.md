# Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DwMRI)

DwMRI can provide information that can be further used to generate diffusion tensors. After which, we can visualize the white matter and associated microstructural properties for body tissues. In our lab, we use DwMRIs to visualize peripheral nerves and major white matter pathways within the brain. For more details on how to set up a Linux environment to perform these analyses, see below.
