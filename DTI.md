### Diffusion Tensor Imaging

Diffusion tensor imaging or DTI is used to visualize the white matter and associated microstructural properties for body tissues. In our lab, we use DTI to visualize peripheral nerves and major white matter pathways within the brain. For more details on how to set up a Linux environment to perform DTI analyses.< click [here](DTI)>

Here are some steps to set-up your machine for DTI analyses:
1. Mrtrix3
2. blob
3. fish
