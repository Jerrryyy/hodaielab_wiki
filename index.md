## Welcome

Welcome to Hodaie Lab, to get you started here are some basics of what we do in the lab.

If you got any questions, feel free to reach out to any of us!

### Diffusion Tensor Imaging
Diffusion tensor imaging or DTI is used to visual the white matter and associated microstructural properties for body tissues. In our lab, we use DTI to visualize peripheral nerves and major white matter pathways within the brain. For more details on how to set up a Linux environment to perform DTI analyses, click [here](DTI)

### Anatomical MRI
Anatomical MRI is used to visualize gross anatomical structure non-invasively in humans. In our lab, we use anatomical MRI (T1-weighted and T2-weighted) with or without contrast to identify particular regions within the PNS and CNS of humans. This allows us to then examine differences/abnormalities that may exist between diseased and healthy control individuals.
